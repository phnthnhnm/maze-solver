# maze-solver

## Project Description

This is a simple maze solver simulator, following the guided project on [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev), that allows users to visualize the process of solving mazes using various algorithms, currently including **DFS**, **BFS** and **A\***.

The project is built using Python and utilizes the Tkinter library for the GUI.

## How to Run

### Prebuilt Binaries (Windows Only)

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/phnthnhnm/maze-solver/releases) page.
